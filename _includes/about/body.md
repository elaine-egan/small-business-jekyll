Unless you’re a really well known brand (think Coca-Cola), you need to introduce yourself and your business very early in the user journey.

Your mission might be included in tagline format with the header logo. All pages of the site should communicate the business mission or purpose of the site, and this should be supported with a well-crafted “About Us” page.

Your website is a way for you to connect with qualified users. It should allow you to inform them and provoke a response from them. Users might call to hire your services or they sign up to your newsletter.

It must be easy for your user to get the information they need – your contact details should ideally be available on all pages of your site. If your individual “Project” page has succeeded in demonstrating organisational credibility, you should be easily contactable from that page while your user is primed and ready to take action.

Don’t assume that users will necessarily navigate through your site. Requiring unnecessary extra clicks may place barriers between your user and the site goal.
